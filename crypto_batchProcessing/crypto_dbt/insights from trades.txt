insights from trades:

1️⃣ You can see who is controlling the market (buyers vs sellers)

agg_trades tells you for each trade:

Was it a buy that forced the price higher?
Or a sell that pushed the price lower?

OHLCV gives only:
“Price moved.”
But who caused the move is hidden.

👉 Insight:
You can see when buyers are stronger than sellers — this often predicts short-term price movement.
----------------------------------------------------------

2️⃣ You can detect big players ("whales")

In agg_trades you see:

When a huge trade suddenly happens

How big it was

What impact it had on the price

OHLCV only shows:

“Volume was high.”
But you don’t know why.

👉 Insight:
In 2020–2024 whales caused many sudden moves — only visible in agg_trades.


got by quantity
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Traffic speed = how often trades happen

High trading speed = lots of trades in short time → market is “hot” → traders are active, excited, reacting to news or trends.
Low trading speed = few trades → market is “quiet” → traders are calm, waiting, or uninterested.

Can measure exact time between trades
Can calculate trades per second
Can find bursts of activity
-----------------------------------
- Trades per second (TPS)
Count how many trades happened in each second.

Interpretation:
TPS high → sudden market activity (maybe news, FOMO, whale trades)
TPS low → market is calm
-----------------------------------
B) Time between trades (inter-trade delay)
Measure the time gap between consecutive trades.

inter_trade_delay = transaction_time - prev_time

Interpretation:
Small delay → trades are coming in milliseconds → very active
Large delay → trades are far apart → quiet market

-----------------------------------
C) Burst detection
Identify periods where trades cluster together in short intervals.
For example: 100 trades in 10 seconds → activity spike.
This is crucial for detecting hot moments that OHLCV smooths over.

(business meaning)
⚡ Market sentiment and trader behavior
Sudden burst in trade speed → traders reacting strongly → possible breakout or dump
Slow trade speed → lack of interest → market consolidating

🐳 Detecting whales or bots

Multiple high-frequency trades in milliseconds → likely algorithmic trading or large players splitting trades

6️⃣ Visualizations for activity

Line chart of trades per second → see bursts
Histogram of inter-trade delays → see periods of calm vs frenzy
Heatmap by hour/minute vs trades per second → identify hot zones
Overlay with price → see if bursts affect price moves

-----------------------------------------------------------------

1️⃣ What “reactions to real events” means

In crypto markets, news triggers sudden reactions:

Exchange listing → price may surge instantly

Regulatory announcement → price may drop quickly

Security hack → panic selling may happen

Traders respond very fast, sometimes in milliseconds.

How to measure reactions
A) Trades per second (TPS)
Count how many trades occurred per second

B) Trade volume per second
Sum quantity or price * quantity per second

C) Price movement vs trade spike
Compare spikes in trades/volume with price jumps.

If a second has:
TPS spike = 500 trades
Volume spike = 20 BTC
Price jump = +$500

This indicates a true market reaction, not just random trading.

5️⃣ Business meaning
Exact timing of reactions: See when traders became aggressive (milliseconds precision).
Market psychology: How fast they buy/sell after news.
Impact of large trades: Did whales jump in immediately?
Predictive signals: Early burst may signal momentum continuation.


5️⃣ Micro-Volatility

Identify rapid up-and-down price swings within an OHLCV candle.

Can signal instability or manipulation.

6️⃣ Trade Size Distribution

How many trades are small vs large?

Are volume spikes caused by few large trades or many small trades?

Average trade size trends over time → retail vs institutional dominance.

7️⃣ Order Flow / Momentum

Consecutive buy or sell streaks → short-term trend strength.

Order flow imbalances can predict price continuation or reversals.

8️⃣ Anomalies / Market Manipulation

Rapid tiny trades (spoofing)

Price spikes caused by very few trades

Unusual clustering → potential pump-and-dump detection

### 1. **Daily Trading Volume by Asset**

**What It Does:**  
This insight aggregates the total traded quantity and value per day for each asset (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.).

**Real Business Benefits:**

- Helps assess which assets are traded most actively, showing where liquidity is high.
    
- Gives insights on when to execute trades to avoid market impact.
    

**Example:**

- **Scenario:** You notice that Bitcoin’s trading volume drops 60% on Sundays, while Ethereum’s volume remains stable.
    

**Explanation in Arabic:**

- إذا لاحظت أن حجم التداول على **البيتكوين (BTC)** ينخفض بنسبة 60% يوم الأحد، فهذا يعني أن السوق غير نشط في ذلك اليوم. إذا كنت تنوي إجراء صفقات كبيرة، من الأفضل تأجيلها إلى الأيام الأخرى من الأسبوع (من الإثنين إلى الجمعة) حيث يكون حجم التداول أعلى. أما إذا كنت تتداول **إيثريوم (ETH)**، فبما أن حجم التداول ثابت حتى في يوم الأحد، يمكنك الاستمرار في تداولك بشكل طبيعي.

### 2. **Average Trade Price by Hour and Asset**

**What It Does:**  
Shows the average price of each asset broken down by hour, along with min/max prices during that hour.

**Real Business Benefits:**

- Helps determine the best time of day to buy an asset when it’s cheaper.
    
- Identifies high-volatility periods, where the price might swing widely.
    

**Example:**

- **Scenario:** You notice that Ethereum (ETH) is consistently 1-2% cheaper between 2 AM and 4 AM UTC.
    

**Explanation in Arabic:**

- إذا لاحظت أن سعر **إيثريوم (ETH)** يكون أقل بنسبة 1-2% بين الساعة 2 صباحًا و 4 صباحًا بتوقيت UTC، يمكنك الاستفادة من هذه الفترة لشراء **إيثريوم** بسعر أقل، مما سيمكنك من تحقيق أرباح عندما تقوم ببيعها لاحقًا في وقت ارتفاع الأسعار.

### 3. **Total Trading Value by Asset (YTD/All-Time)**

**What It Does:**  
Shows the total trading value for each asset either for the current year (YTD) or all-time.

**Real Business Benefits:**

- Identifies which assets generate the most value, helping to decide where to focus trading efforts.
    
- Shows if your portfolio is over-concentrated in one asset, which increases risk.
    

**Example:**

- **Scenario:** 70% of your trading volume is in BTC/ETH, and only 30% is in altcoins.
    

**Explanation in Arabic:**

- إذا كان 70% من حجم تداولك في **البيتكوين (BTC)** و **الإيثريوم (ETH)** فقط، بينما 30% فقط في العملات البديلة، هذا يعني أن محفظتك مركزة بشكل كبير على هذه الأصول. إذا حدث انخفاض مفاجئ في قيمة هاتين العملتين، قد تواجه مخاطر كبيرة. يُنصح بتنويع المحفظة وزيادة التركيز على العملات البديلة لتقليل المخاطر.

### 4. **Month-over-Month Trading Growth**

**What It Does:**  
Shows month-over-month growth or decline in trading volume and number of trades for each asset.

**Real Business Benefits:**

- Tracks growth or slowdown in trading activity.
    
- Identifies seasonal patterns (e.g., certain months tend to see higher or lower volume).
    

**Example:**

- **Scenario:** You notice June’s trading volume is twice that of May, but July’s volume grew only 5%.
    

**Explanation in Arabic:**

- إذا لاحظت أن حجم التداول في **يونيو** ضعف حجم التداول في **مايو**، ولكن في **يوليو** زاد فقط بنسبة 5%، قد يكون هذا بسبب العوامل الموسمية أو توقف الحملات التسويقية. من الأفضل إعادة إطلاق الحملات التسويقية في الشهر التالي مثل أغسطس للحصول على نتائج أفضل.

### 5. **Asset Market Share (% of Total Trading Value)**

**What It Does:**  
Shows what percentage of total trading value each asset represents in your portfolio.

**Real Business Benefits:**

- Shows how concentrated or diversified your portfolio is.
    
- Indicates which assets are growing or declining in market share.
    

**Example:**

- **Scenario:** You notice Bitcoin's market share drops from 45% to 35%, while Solana (SOL) grows from 5% to 20%.
    

**Explanation in Arabic:**

- إذا لاحظت أن **نسبة البيتكوين** في محفظتك انخفضت من 45% إلى 35% بينما **سولانا (SOL)** زادت من 5% إلى 20%، فهذا يدل على تزايد الإقبال على سولانا. يفضل النظر في تنويع المحفظة وتركيز استثماراتك بشكل أكبر على سولانا لتقليل الاعتماد على البيتكوين.
    

---

### 6. **Price Volatility by Asset (Std Dev)**

**What It Does:**  
Measures the volatility (standard deviation) of an asset's price. High volatility means the price fluctuates more.

**Real Business Benefits:**

- Helps assess risk. Highly volatile assets might have higher profit potential but also more risk.
    
- Can help you set proper stop-loss levels.
    

**Example:**

- **Scenario:** Solana has 12% volatility, but Bitcoin only has 3%.
    

**Explanation in Arabic:**

- إذا كانت **سولانا (SOL)** أكثر تقلبًا بنسبة 12% مقارنة بـ **البيتكوين (BTC)** التي تملك تقلبًا بنسبة 3%، فهذا يشير إلى أن **سولانا** قد تكون عرضة لتقلبات سعرية أكبر. يمكنك تعديل استراتيجيات **الوقف (stop-loss)** لتكون أكثر مرونة عند التعامل مع **سولانا** لتقليل المخاطر.

### 7. **Peak Trading Times (by Day of Week and Hour)**

**What It Does:**  
Identifies the times of the day and days of the week when the highest trading activity occurs.

**Real Business Benefits:**

- Helps plan when to execute trades for better liquidity.
    
- Assists with system maintenance scheduling during low-activity times.
    

**Example:**

- **Scenario:** You discover Friday nights have 3x the volume of Wednesday mornings.
    

**Explanation in Arabic:**

- إذا اكتشفت أن حجم التداول يوم **الجمعة مساءً** أعلى بثلاث مرات من يوم **الأربعاء صباحًا**، يمكنك استغلال هذه الفترات لتحقيق أفضل أداء تجاري، على سبيل المثال، إطلاق حملات تسويقية أو ميزات جديدة في أوقات الذروة مثل **الجمعة مساءً**.
    

---

### 8. **Large Trade Detection (Anomalies)**

**What It Does:**  
Flags unusually large trades, especially those that are 2x or more the average trade size for that asset.

**Real Business Benefits:**

- Detects "whale" trades, which could indicate large market movements.
    
- Helps identify potential market manipulation or fraud.
    

**Example:**

- **Scenario:** A user deposits 1000 BTC and shorts it across multiple exchanges, then reverses the position.
    

**Explanation in Arabic:**

- إذا لاحظت أن **مستخدمًا قام بإيداع 1000 بيتكوين** ثم قام **ببيعهم على عدة منصات**، قد يكون هذا مؤشرًا على **محاولة تلاعب في السوق** أو **مؤامرة مؤقتة** ضد أسعار البيتكوين. يفضل التحقيق في هذه المعاملة بشكل دقيق.

### 9. **Average Trade Size by Asset & Trader Segment (NEW)**

**What It Does:**  
Segments traders by their trade size (retail, institutional, whale) and shows the average order size for each asset.

**Real Business Benefits:**

- Helps you understand the type of traders for each asset.
    
- Allows you to adapt your strategies for different trader types (retail vs institutional).
    

**Example:**

- **Scenario:** You notice that large traders (whales) are mostly trading BTC and ETH, while retail traders are more focused on altcoins like Solana (SOL).
    

**Explanation in Arabic:**

- إذا لاحظت أن **المتداولين الكبار (whales)** يتداولون **البيتكوين (BTC)** و **الإيثريوم (ETH)**، بينما يركز **المتداولون الصغار** أكثر على العملات البديلة مثل **سولانا (SOL)**، يمكنك تعديل استراتيجياتك لتناسب نوع المتداولين. على سبيل المثال، يمكن إنشاء منصات خاصة للمؤسسات المالية وتوفير واجهات أكثر سهولة للمبتدئين.
    

---

### 10. **Price Impact Analysis (Correlation Between Size & Movement) (NEW)**

**What It Does:**  
Analyzes how much large trades impact asset prices, showing the correlation between trade size and price movement.

**Real Business Benefits:**

- Helps you predict slippage before executing large trades.
    
- Guides optimal execution strategies (e.g., use VWAP for large trades).
    

**Example:**

- **Scenario:** You find that large trades in Solana cause a 0.8% price impact, while large trades in Bitcoin only cause a 0.2% impact.
    

**Explanation in Arabic:**

- إذا كنت تلاحظ أن صفقات **سولانا** الكبيرة تؤثر على السعر بنسبة 0.8% بينما في **البيتكوين** التأثير أقل بنسبة 0.2%، يمكنك تعديل استراتيجياتك المالية للاستفادة من **البيتكوين** الذي يظهر تأثير أقل من سولانا، وبالتالي يمكن نقل بعض رأس المال للاستثمار فيه لتقليل التأثير الناتج عن الصفقات الكبيرة في سولانا.
