1) Clear — What insights you can get from OHLCV (plain language)

(These are the things OHLCV can tell you that matter for an analyst / dashboard viewer)

Price / Trend

Long- and medium-term trend: is the asset generally going up, down, or flat?

Hourly momentum: how strong was each hour’s move?

Volatility / Risk

How “bumpy” the price is inside each hour (big swings = high volatility).

Historical volatility trend (is the market getting calmer or wilder?).

Volume & Liquidity

How much money/asset traded in each hour (how liquid is the market?).

Aggressive buying vs selling (which side initiated trades).

Volume spikes that often accompany real moves.

Candle structure & market psychology

Candle type (bullish/bearish/doji) — shows buyer/seller control or indecision during the hour.

Wick sizes — rejection zones where price was pushed back (potential support/resistance).

Trend confirmation & signals

MA crossovers (short MA vs long MA) — short-term vs medium-term trend alignment.

Price + volume confirmation (price up + volume up is stronger than price up with low volume).

High-level performance

Cumulative return from start date (how much $1 invested would have grown).

Percent of time the market was UP/DOWN/SIDEWAYS.

Time patterns & sessions

Hour-of-day / day-of-week patterns (when is activity highest?).

Seasonality across months/years (bull markets vs bear markets).

Derived business signals

Breakout vs fakeout detection (big candle + volume spike = likely real breakout).

Liquidity stress (big move + low volume = risky, high slippage).

2) Organized list of measures to compute in GOLD (grouped and precise)

I’ll give the field name and a one-line explanation. These are the exact columns your Gold table should include.
---------------------------------------------------------
A — Basic price + identity done

ohlcv_sk — surrogate PK (unique per candle)

asset_pair_symbol, base_asset_symbol, quote_asset_symbol

period_start, period_end (timestamp)
---------------------------------------------------------
B — Returns / Trend done

open, high, low, close

return_abs = close - open (USD/quote change)

return_pct = (close - open) / open

cumulative_return = ∏(1 + return_pct) - 1 (compounded from series start)

C — Moving averages / trend smoothing

ma_10 = average(close over last 10 periods)

ma_20 = average(close over last 20 periods)

ma_trend = categorical (MA10>MA20 → bullish; MA10<MA20 → bearish; else sideways)

ma_crossover_flag = flag when MA10 crosses MA20 this candle
---------------------------------------------------------
D — Candle geometry (structure) done

candle_range = high - low

range_pct = (high - low) / open

body_size = abs(close - open)

upper_wick = high - max(open, close)

lower_wick = min(open, close) - low

candle_type = doji / bullish / bearish (rule: small body -> doji, else close>open -> bullish)
---------------------------------------------------------
E — Volatility

true_range = max(high-low, abs(high-prev_close), abs(low-prev_close))

atr_14 = average(true_range over 14 periods)

rolling_vol_10 = stddev(close over 10 periods)

rolling_vol_20 = stddev(close over 20 periods)

volatility_label = categorical (Low / Normal / High) based on thresholds
---------------------------------------------------------
F — Volume & liquidity

base_asset_volume (VOLUME) — base units traded in candle

quote_asset_volume — quote currency traded

volume_sma_20 = avg(quote_asset_volume over 20 periods)

volume_spike_flag = quote_asset_volume > k * volume_sma_20 (k=2 default)

vwap_proxy = (high + low + close)/3 (use real VWAP from trades if available)
---------------------------------------------------------
G — Buy / Sell pressure (aggregated)

taker_buy_base_volume

taker_buy_quote_volume

buy_ratio_quote = taker_buy_quote_volume / quote_asset_volume (null safe)

buy_ratio_base = taker_buy_base_volume / base_asset_volume (null safe)

sell_ratio_quote = 1 - buy_ratio_quote

aggression_index = abs(buy_ratio_base - 0.5) * base_asset_volume (higher = one side dominating)

rolling_buy_ratio_5 = avg(buy_ratio_quote over 5 periods)
---------------------------------------------------------
H — Signals & flags

breakout_flag = volume_spike_flag AND candle_range or return_pct above threshold

liquidity_stress_flag = large return_pct && low volume_sma_20

whale_proxy = (if you later add trades agg) max_trade_size / avg_trade_size per candle
---------------------------------------------------------
I — Metadata
num_trades, loaded_at done





first insight in dashboard:
✔ return_pct

Shows if the candle was bullish or bearish.

✔ ma_10 and ma_20

Smooth the price curve → you clearly see real trend direction.
MA crossovers are strong trading signals:

MA10 > MA20 = bullish

MA10 < MA20 = bearish

✔ cumulative_return

Tells you how much the asset grew since 2020.

BTC cumulative return example: +450%

ETH cumulative return example: +900%

This is the main metric investors care about.

✔ trend_direction

Gives clean color labels for Power BI visuals.
